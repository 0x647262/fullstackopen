# 0.4: New Note

## Directions:

In chapter [Loading a page containing JavaScript - revised](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#loading-a-page-containing-java-script-revised) the chain of events caused by opening the page https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes is depicted as a [sequence diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/)

The diagram was made using [websequencediagrams](https://www.websequencediagrams.com/) service as follows:

```
browser->server: HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes
server-->browser: HTML-code
browser->server: HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css
server-->browser: main.css
browser->server: HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.js
server-->browser: main.js

note over browser:
browser starts executing js-code
that requests JSON data from server
end note

browser->server: HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json
server-->browser: [{ content: "HTML is easy", date: "2019-05-23" }, ...]

note over browser:
browser executes the event handler
that renders notes to display
end note
```

**Create a similar diagram** depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on page https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the submit button.

If necessary, show operations on the browser or on the server as comments on the diagram.

The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way of presenting the events is fine.

All necessary information for doing this, and the next two exercises, can be found from the text of [this part](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#forms-and-http-post). The idea of these exercises is to read the text through once more, and to think through what is going on where. Reading the application [code](https://github.com/mluukkai/example_app) is not necessary, but it is of course possible.

## Solution:

"Foo bar baz qux" is entered into the text field https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes and the "save" button is clicked:

```
browser -> server  : HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 302, response: None
Notes: Page begins to reload after submitting the note.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/html (HTML Document)
Notes: A plain HTML page is loaded.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/css (File: main.css)
Notes: Styles have been applied to the previous HTML page, however no notes are present.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.js
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/javascript (File: main.js)
Notes: xhttp.open and xhttp.send from main.js are executed to retrieve data.json.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/json (File: data.json)
Notes: Notes from data.json are parsed by functions within main.js and
       rendered onto the page.
```
