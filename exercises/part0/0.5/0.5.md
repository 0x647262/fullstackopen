# 0.5: Single Page App

## Directions:

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the [single page app](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#single-page-app) version of the notes app at https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa.

## Solution:

A user navigates to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa:

```
browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/html (HTML Document)
Notes: A plain HTML page is loaded.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/css (File: main.css)
Notes: Styles have been applied to the previous HTML page, however no notes are present.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa.js
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/javascript (File: spa.js)
Notes: Once downloaded, spa.js requests data.json from
       https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/json (File: data.json)
Notes: Notes from data.json are parsed by functions in spa.js and rendered
       onto the page.
```

HTTP archive file (HAR): [0.5.har](0.5.har)
