# 0.6: New Note

## Directions:

Create a diagram depicting the situation where user creates a new note using the single page version of the app.

## Solution:

The initial page is loaded exactly the same as excercise [0.5](0.5.md):

```
browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/html (HTML Document)
Notes: A plain HTML page is loaded.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: text/css (File: main.css)
Notes: Styles have been applied to the previous HTML page, however no notes are present.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa.js
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/javascript (File: spa.js)
Notes: Once downloaded, spa.js requests data.json from
       https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com.

browser -> server  : HTTP GET https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 200, Content type: application/json (File: data.json)
Notes: Notes from data.json are parsed by functions in spa.js and rendered
       onto the page.
```

"Foo bar baz qux" is entered into the text field https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa and the "save" button is clicked:

```

browser -> server  : HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
server  -> browser : HTTP status: 201, Content type: application/json (a JSON object is returned)
Notes: After the POST is made, the page does not reload, rather the
       redrawNotes() function of spa.js is triggered, and the page is
       "re-rendered" with the new note appended to the notes list.
```

HTTP archive file (HAR): [0.6.har](0.6.har)
